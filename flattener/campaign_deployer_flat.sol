/**
 * @title RefundableCrowdsale
 * @dev Extension of Crowdsale contract that adds a funding goal, and
 * the possibility of users getting a refund if goal is not met.
 * WARNING: note that if you allow tokens to be traded before the goal 
 * is met, then an attack is possible in which the attacker purchases 
 * tokens from the crowdsale and when they sees that the goal is 
 * unlikely to be met, they sell their tokens (possibly at a discount).
 * The attacker will be refunded when the crowdsale is finalized, and
 * the users that purchased from them will be left with worthless 
 * tokens. There are many possible ways to avoid this, like making the
 * the crowdsale inherit from PostDeliveryCrowdsale, or imposing 
 * restrictions on token trading until the crowdsale is finalized.
 * This is being discussed in 
 * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/issues/877
 * This contract will be updated when we agree on a general solution
 * for this problem.
